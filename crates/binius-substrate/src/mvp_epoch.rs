//! MVP — a complete end-to-end epoch package: publish, verify once, resolve offline.
//!
//! ## What this is
//!
//! Three roles, wired together over REAL artefacts:
//!
//! 1. **Operator (once per epoch)** builds a zone of ECDSA-signed delegations plus an NSEC3
//!    chain, validates every signature natively, aggregates the positive records into a trustless
//!    epoch proof ([`crate::epoch_c1`]), and proves the NSEC3 chain is a gap-free cover bound to
//!    its own committed leaves ([`crate::nsec3_bind`]). It publishes an [`EpochPackage`].
//! 2. **Resolver (once per epoch)** verifies the package: the epoch aggregation, then the
//!    completeness proof against a 32-byte zone pin it holds out of band.
//! 3. **Resolver (per query, offline)** answers positive lookups by opening a record against the
//!    epoch root, and answers NXDOMAIN by appeal to the already-verified completeness proof.
//!
//! ## What is real here, and what is not
//!
//! Everything on the verification path is a real cryptographic check: real ECDSA signatures, real
//! per-record FRI commitments and openings ([`crate::epoch_c1::fold_epoch_c1`] consumes the actual
//! leaves), and a real STARK proof of NSEC3 completeness whose committed leaves are channel-bound
//! to the constrained chain. Nothing here calls `measure_epoch_verify_hash`, which is a
//! random-witness COST MODEL and cannot verify anything.
//!
//! The honest limits, which the demo prints rather than hides:
//! * The positive-record epoch and the completeness artefact are **two** separately-bound
//!   constructions verified in sequence, not one artefact spanning both. Wiring the chain's leaf
//!   set into the epoch aggregation is the remaining step.
//! * The zone pin covers the completeness proof's whole committed witness, so it is specific to a
//!   circuit version.
//! * Record validity is established natively by the operator at publish time (Model A); the epoch
//!   binds *which bytes* are committed, not that they carry valid signatures.
//!
//! ## Authenticated denial (NXDOMAIN)
//!
//! The chain is `H(name)` over **this epoch's own names**, sorted and cyclically linked, and it is
//! pinned two ways: leaf-set boundaries force the shipped chain to be the one the proof committed,
//! and a 32-byte out-of-band pin forces that committed chain to be this zone's. A miss then
//! returns the *covering interval* whose endpoints straddle the queried hash. Because the chain
//! was proved a gap-free cyclic cover, a hash strictly inside an interval cannot be a name of the
//! zone --- so the denial is proved rather than asserted. Conversely every committed name is
//! **undeniable**: its hash IS an owner, so no interval covers it and no denial can be
//! manufactured for a name the zone commits.
//!
//! Remaining honesty about denial: the resolver holds the chain (`O(n)`) to locate the interval.
//! A resolver that wants to hold only the 32-byte pin would need a per-query opening of the
//! covering leaf rather than the whole chain; the machinery for that is the same record-opening
//! path used for positive answers, and is not wired here.
