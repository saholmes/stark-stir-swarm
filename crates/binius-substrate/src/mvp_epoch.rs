//! MVP — a complete end-to-end epoch package: publish, verify once, resolve offline.
//!
//! ## What this is
//!
//! Three roles, wired together over REAL artefacts:
//!
//! 1. **Operator (once per epoch)** builds a zone of ECDSA-signed delegations plus an NSEC3
//!    chain, validates every signature natively, aggregates the positive records into a trustless
//!    epoch proof ([`crate::epoch_c1`]), and proves the NSEC3 chain is a gap-free cover bound to
//!    its own committed leaves ([`crate::nsec3_bind`]). It publishes an [`EpochPackage`].
//! 2. **Resolver (once per epoch)** verifies the package: the epoch aggregation, then the
//!    completeness proof against a 32-byte zone pin it holds out of band.
//! 3. **Resolver (per query, offline)** answers positive lookups by opening a record against the
//!    epoch root, and answers NXDOMAIN by appeal to the already-verified completeness proof.
//!
//! ## What is real here, and what is not
//!
//! Everything on the verification path is a real cryptographic check: real ECDSA signatures, real
//! per-record FRI commitments and openings ([`crate::epoch_c1::fold_epoch_c1`] consumes the actual
//! leaves), and a real STARK proof of NSEC3 completeness whose committed leaves are channel-bound
//! to the constrained chain. Nothing here calls `measure_epoch_verify_hash`, which is a
//! random-witness COST MODEL and cannot verify anything.
//!
//! The honest limits, which the demo prints rather than hides:
//! * The positive-record epoch and the completeness artefact are **two** separately-bound
//!   constructions verified in sequence, not one artefact spanning both. Wiring the chain's leaf
//!   set into the epoch aggregation is the remaining step.
//! * The zone pin covers the completeness proof's whole committed witness, so it is specific to a
//!   circuit version.
//! * Record validity is established natively by the operator at publish time (Model A); the epoch
//!   binds *which bytes* are committed, not that they carry valid signatures.
//! * ★★ **THE NXDOMAIN PATH IS NOT YET BOUND TO THIS ZONE'S NAMES.** The completeness proof
//!   covers a *synthetic* chain (`nsec3_bind` generates its own), not the hashes of the names in
//!   this epoch, and [`resolve`] answers a miss by a linear scan of the committed name list rather
//!   than by proving the queried name's hash falls in a covering NSEC3 interval. So the demo shows
//!   the two artefacts verifying and composing operationally, but a denial here rests on "the
//!   operator's name list does not contain it" plus an *unrelated* complete chain. Closing this
//!   needs the chain derived from `H(name)` over the epoch's own names, and a covering-interval
//!   check in `resolve`. Until then do not read the NXDOMAIN result as a proved denial.
